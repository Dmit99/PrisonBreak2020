# PrisonBreak2020
PrisonBreak2020 by Dmitri Jacobs GD3A

Welcome to Dmitri's PrisonBreak.
Pull the project to your pc and make a build or check it in the Unity3D Engine itself.
First you will be in prison. You have to pickup a stone.

IMPORTANT: Only just pickup one stone at a time or you have to restart the hole game when you didn't throw it correctly. 

After that your cell door opens and you can walk out. But the alarm is punched! 
Find the key in the prison that should be in one of the other cells.
You could pickup some heavy cigarettes as a bonus!
Once you have found your key you can open the door and the key will be dropped automatically.

API DOOR:
Scan the Bar code with Google Authenticator. And you will receive a "Dmitri the prisoner" prisonbreak 2020 number.
Type that number on the screen but watch out the numbers change in order after you pressed one.

Procedural Generated world:
After that you have to wait until the procedural generation with your unique code in the main menu is generated.
Find the boat parts that you could see on your minimap as well as in the world.
Once you have enough parts collected you can press escape and you will see a small cutscene that you've escaped the island!

congratulations! You completed the small adventure!
